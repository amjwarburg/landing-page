# landing-page
The Odin Project's "landing page" project

This project required me to learn much more css and html. One thing I learned in particular was the 'border-radius' command which adds a bevel to the corners of an item, rounding them. 

I want to take away the fact that margins are very important for centering an item. Until I find a better solution, this should help immensely.
